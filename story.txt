Once upon a time, I was on my way to Schloss Eltz for a picnic. I packed some Apfelkuchen as a snack in my pinic basket. 
I brought my hund along for a walk as well.  
We passed by a bratwurst stand and my hund started to run torwards it.  
I bought tickets to see Rammstein live in concert next month.
Suddenly, Neue Deutsche Härte industrial metal band Rammstein stepped out of a nearby Biergarten to help me catch my hund!
For lunch, I would like to have a Bratwurst with some mustard on the side.
Suddenly, Neue Deutsche Härte industrial metal band Rammstein stepped out of a nearby Biergarten to help me catch my hund! My hund rand into the Biergarten and almost knocked someone over. One of the members was wearing lederhose. I looked better because I was wearing a dirndel.
